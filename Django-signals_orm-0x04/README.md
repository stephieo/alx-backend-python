# Django Signals Implementation

This project directory (`/home/steph/alx-backend-python/Django-signals_orm-0x04/`) is focused on demonstrating the implementation of Django's signal system only.
#INCOMPLETE: After implementing the signals, i need to update this project to match the middleware project content for a more robust app.

The primary goal is to showcase how signals can be used to trigger actions in response to model events (e.g., `pre_save`, `post_save`).
